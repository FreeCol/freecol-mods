### New Nations by Mazim

* Origin: [Sourceforge Topic](https://sourceforge.net/p/freecol/discussion/141200/thread/658935e76f/)
* Description: Mod contains Italy, Belgium, Germany and Otoman Empire. You will like to play in the africa map with these nations that will complement your game. I made others too but i dont know if you will want. i made others like aragon, scotland, china etc. Its just for fun. A fact, I put european cities names in these nations city name because, I dont have a historical city list here. I hope you enjoy.
