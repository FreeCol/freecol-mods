* Download: [New Nations by Mazim v2.0](https://github.com/FreeCol/freecol-mods/releases/tag/v2.0-new-nations-by-mazim)
* Description: Mod contains Italy, Belgium, Germany and Otoman Empire. You will like to play in the africa map with these nations that will complement your game. I made others too but i dont know if you will want. i made others like aragon, scotland, china etc. Its just for fun. A fact, I put european cities names in these nations city name because, I dont have a historical city list here. I hope you enjoy.
